# Oracle Aerospace Cloud Modeling

I am a graduate of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering with enterprise experience in aerospace analytics, predictive modeling, and strategic cloud deployment. This repository presents a representative simulation of the technical architecture and operational logic I supported during my time at Oracle in service of aerospace and defense clients.

While the data and modeling structure have been adapted for public demonstration, the framework reflects the engagement style, analytical rigor, and structured methodology used across multiple sales and solution cycles. My contributions consistently focused on driving adoption of data-centric decision platforms, enhancing operational visibility, and enabling mission-aligned cost efficiencies.

## Project Overview

This repository simulates cloud-enabled analytics workflows tailored for enterprise aerospace environments. The modeling logic and structural organization reflect the strategic technical frameworks used to support flight operations optimization, intelligence application design, and mission assurance modeling.

## Repository Structure

- `modeling/`: Simulated analytics notebook  
- `data/`: Fictional metrics used for demonstration  
- `strategy/`: Engagement notes reflecting client-facing logic

## Objective

To document the structural modeling principles and workflow logic that informed enterprise cloud engagements across aerospace and defense sectors. The project reflects not only technical fluency but the measured judgment required to translate data architecture into operational value.
