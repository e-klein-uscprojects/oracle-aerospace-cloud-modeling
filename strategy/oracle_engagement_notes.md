## Oracle Engagement Notes

I am a graduate of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering with enterprise experience in aerospace analytics. During my time at Oracle, I helped aviation and defense clients deploy scalable cloud models that supported operational strategy and mission alignment.

In one case, we configured analytics logic to streamline flight telemetry against historical maintenance cycles. The framework enabled the client to reduce resource friction and recover operational consistency across four platforms.

The second initiative involved supporting ISR mission planning with predictive component tracking and dashboard design. We prototyped a cloud environment that allowed high-fidelity tracking with latency buffers removed.

These notes reflect representative technical strategy used during enterprise engagements where operational efficiency and cloud integration were mission-critical.
